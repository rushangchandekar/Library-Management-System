# Library Management System üìö

This is a simple **C++ program** for managing a library system. The system is designed to handle essential library operations, such as managing books, borrowing and returning books, and tracking due dates. The application uses a command-line interface and implements the basic workflow of a library system as shown in the use case diagram.

---

## Features ‚ú®

- **Librarian Login**: Ensures secure access to library management features.
- **Manage Books**:
  - Add new books with ID, title, and author.
  - Update book details (title and author).
  - Remove books from the library.
  - Search for books by ID.
- **Borrow and Return Books**:
  - Allows users to borrow available books.
  - Handles the return of borrowed books.
- **Due Date Check** (Placeholder for future implementation).
- **View Books**:
  - Lists all books in the library, along with their status (available or borrowed).

---

## Workflow

The application is based on a simple command-line interface where:
1. The **librarian** can log in to manage the books in the library.
2. The **borrower** can borrow and return books.
3. The system keeps track of borrowed books to ensure availability.

Refer to the following **use case diagram** for a visual representation of the workflow:
